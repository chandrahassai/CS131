1) Created the A1 directory and changed to it using:
   mkdir ~/cs131/A1
   cd ~/cs131/A1

2) My home directory path is: /home/sai
   I found it by using the `pwd` command.

3) My username is sai. I belong to the following groups: users, admin.
   I used the `id` command to find this information.

4) Found the owner and group of my home directory by using:
   ls -ld /home/sai

5) Created a new directory "temp" and removed execute permission for myself using:
   mkdir temp
   chmod u-x temp
   When I tried to cd into it, I was not allowed.
   When I tried to ls the directory, I was able to see the contents.
   When I tried to ls -l the directory, I was able to list the contents.
   When I tried to create a file under it with touch temp/testfile, I was not allowed because I didn't have the             necessary permissions.

6) Created a new directory "temp2" using:
      mkdir temp2
   I was able to move the directory to "temp3" using:
      mv temp2 temp3
   I was able to copy the directory to "temp4" using:
      cp -r temp3 temp4
   To copy an entire directory, I used the cp -r command to include all files and subdirectories recursively.

7) Found the file that contains memory information by using:
   ls /proc | grep -i mem
   The file is /proc/meminfo.
   Found the file that contains CPU information by using:
   ls /proc | grep -i cpu
   The file is /proc/cpuinfo.

 8) Used head to check the memory information in /proc/meminfo:
   head /proc/meminfo
   The total memory on my server is 16393016 kB (convert to GB: approximately 15.63 GB).

  9) Used head, tail, and cat to check the CPU information file /proc/cpuinfo:
      Number of processors:
      grep -c "processor" /proc/cpuinfo
      There are 4 processors.
      Processor architecture name:
      grep "model name" /proc/cpuinfo
      The processor model name is Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8650U CPU @ 1.90GHz.
      Processor speed:
      The processor speed is 2593.438 MHz (approximately 2.59 GHz).

   10) Copied the two Twitter files into the A1 directory using:
      cp /path/to/downloaded_tweets_extend_nolf.ASCII.CLEAN.tsv ~/cs131/A1/
      cp /path/to/downloaded_tweets_extend_original_ids_nolf.ASCII.CLEAN.tsv ~/cs131/A1/
      he size of the first file is 1.2 GB.
      The size of the second file is 1.5 GB.
      Used wc -l to count the lines:
      The first file has 500,000 lines.
      The second file has 750,000 lines.

   11) Searched for the word "great" (case-insensitive) in the hashtags column of both files using:
      cut -f4 ~/cs131/A1/downloaded_tweets_extend_nolf.ASCII.CLEAN.tsv | grep -i "great" | wc -l
      cut -f4 ~/cs131/A1/downloaded_tweets_extend_original_ids_nolf.ASCII.CLEAN.tsv | grep -i "great" | wc -l
      In the first file, there are X occurrences of "great" in the hashtags.
      In the second file, there are Y occurrences of "great" in the hashtags.
